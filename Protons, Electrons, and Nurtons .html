What Is a Proton 
</h3>

<pre>
						A proton is one of the subatomic particle that make up matter. A subatomic                                              
						particle is a particle that is smaller than a atom in size. Atoms are made 
						up of three subatomic particles protons,electrons, and neutrons. Matter is 
						made up of molecules which are composed of two or more atoms.The mass of a  					
						proton is 1.67262 × 10−27 kg a bit less than a neutron, they are madeup of
						quarks there are six diffrent types of quarks the quarks that construct a
						proton are two up quarks and one down quark the up quark is the lightest of
						all quarks. Protons has a positive charge,a positive charge is when an atom 
						has more protons than electrons those are the basics.

<h3>
What Is a Neutron
</h3>
<pre "p class="solid">
						A neutron is also a subatomic particle that makes up matter. What makes up
						matter are atoms,atoms have electrons and are build up from the nucleus which
						is made up of neutrons and protons. Unlike protons neutrons do not have an
						electric charge nore do they have a negative charge like electrons, neutrons
						have no electrical charge. Neutrons are sligtly heavier than protons.A neutron 
						is classified as a hadron. There are two types hadrons one is a baryon and mesons 
						a neutron is a baryon. Baryon are madeup of three quarks 2 down quarks and 1 up
						quark, the mass of a neutron is 1.674927471(21) * 10-27kg. There are six diffrent 
						types of quarks the up,charm,top,down,strange,and bottom quark.

<h3>
What is an Electrons
</h3>
<pre>
						A electron is an subatomic particle that has a negative charge. Both protons and 
						electrons have the same charge but the opposite electric charge. Protons and electron 
						cancel each other out. The size of an electron is no yet known but it is known that 
						they aresmaller than 10-18cm and the mass of anelectron is 9x10-31kg. Electrons orbit 
						outside of the nucleus, the nucleus is a central piece of an atom. The electron was founded 
						in 1897 and J.J. Thomson founded the electron. Compared to a proton and a neutron the electron
						is the lightest of both.
